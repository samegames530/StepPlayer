- Song files are intentionally **excluded from Git**
- This allows asynchronous collaboration focused on music and chart creation
- The Git repository contains engine and code only

⚠ This folder is intentionally kept empty in the Git repository.
Song files are managed via Google Drive and copied here for local development.
